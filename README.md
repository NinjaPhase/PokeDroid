# PokeDroid for Users
## Introduction
PokeDroid (Initially YAPJE) is an Desktop and Android Java driven Pokémon Engine.

The engine itself will be made to run using what are called Story's, which are a collection of JSON,
image and music files that the engine will interpret at the start, load in the data from the Story
and you will be able to play through a downloaded story.

The entirety of PokeDroid will be based around this story system, without a story you won't have
anything to play. There will be a story included within the source code as a sample and a playable
game, for those sceptical about loading more stories.

## What features will be included?
I have many aims for PokeDroid, these are:
  1. Construct the pokemon engine based around customisation, battling and map traversal.
  2. Allow creators to make their own stories, allowing for unique gameplay and custom features.
  3. Construct an editor (Like the RPG Maker system) to make these stories with.
  4. Have fun working on a project which I love.

## Features included so far:
  1. Story's can be loaded in and only the current story is loaded.
  2. The map can be traversed, there is collision, ledge jumping, connections and encounter tables.
  3. The battle system is underway, there is a basis of pokemon (all pokemon included to 649) but
  they're unusable.
  4. The event system is being created, so far events are able to warp (used for doors),
  cause message's and tint the screen along with some variable functions and conditionals
  (meaning random events are possible and actions have responses).

## Why use the story system?
The reason behind the story system is to allow those with and without programming knowledge to create
their own Pokémon game. An editor will be used to allow for the creation of maps, tilesets, events and
even GUI's. This makes each story truly unique allowing for advanced functions.

## What generation will the engine use?
The engine will attempt to emulate all generations, so far the emulated generation is generation 3
with generation 5 pokémon. This is due to it being the last generation which was truly 2D-based.

The beauty of the story system is that it will allow for all generations to be emulated, meaning if
you felt like playing a generation 2 game, just load in a generation 2 story and you will be able to
play within that generation.

## Will you be including any official Pokémon Storylines?
I'm considering including a revamped version of the Pokémon Gold and Silver storyline with the engine
in generation 3 format, allowing for fully playable game. It may take some time but in the meanwhile
you'll be able to play all the other creations by other PokeDroid creators.

# PokeDroid for Content Creators

## Introduction
As a content creator you will probably be writing story's, GUI's or features.

I am hoping to add a repository for trusted content creators to develop their content on and place
it so that players and content creators could download from within the application, however this i
sonly a maybe.

## Will I be provided with any tools?
I am hoping to create an editor which will function much like RPG Maker XP (Pokemon Essentials), however
this will be much more geared towards pokemon story creation and will have expanded features based on
this, such as gamemode creation, and cross-story functionality.

## What could I expect as a story creator?
As a story creator you should be able to:
  1. Create maps and tilesets, and place events on these maps to create a dynamic, eventful world.
  2. Create GUI's utilising variables and events to create new systems (e.g. A leveling system, a fishing system, a farming system).
  3. Use the editor to further help your creations
  4. Not be restricted by a single generation and also increase the amount of pokemon by adding Fakemon, to create an entirely new story with new pokemon.
